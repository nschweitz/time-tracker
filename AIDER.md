This is my time tracker software. The idea is to take a screenshot every minute
and have an AI figure out what's on the screen, then categorize the result.

- Keep the code as simple as possible
- Never add error handling unless I explicitly ask for it. Just die instantly.
- Only support the minimum set of features necessary
- Never worry about backwards compatability.
